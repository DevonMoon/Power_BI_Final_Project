The dataset comprises a total of 889 passengers, consisting of 577 males and 312 females. Among the female passengers, 231 survived, whereas 109 of the male passengers survived.

In terms of passenger distribution by class, Class 3 accommodated the largest number of passengers, while Class 1 had the fewest occupants.

Analyzing the embarkation ports, it is evident that the majority of passengers boarded in Southampton, while the smallest contingent embarked from Cherbourg.

Furthermore, the analysis underscores a significant trend in survival rates. Specifically, a higher proportion of females, particularly those belonging to the 1st class, survived the Titanic disaster, indicating a correlation between gender, class, and survival outcomes.
